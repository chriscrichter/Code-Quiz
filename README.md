Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

## Description

This timer-based quiz is an application built in HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The player tries to successfully answer coding-related questions within the time limit. Incorrect answers will penalize the score/time by 15 seconds.

When the player loads the application and clicks on the 'Start Quiz' button, the first question is displayed and the timer starts counting down from 75 seconds. Once the answer button is pressed, the next question is displayed. If the answer is incorrect, 15 seconds are deducted from the time remaining. The player must answer all of the questions within the 75 seconds or the game will end. On the final screen, the score is shown and the player can enter their initials to save their high score.
